    <h1>Portfolio</h1>

    <p>
      Below are some highlights of my work in football scouting, recruitment and analysis — from operational roles within clubs to independent data-driven projects.  
      I’ve worked across men’s and women’s football, applying a blend of video, data and tactical insight to support talent identification, opposition analysis and recruitment workflows.
    </p>

    <h2>Clubs & Roles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>London City Lionesses</strong> – Recruitment Analyst Intern. Joined the club in April 2022 after earlier roles in the Dutch men’s game and Swedish women’s top division. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>VVV‑Venlo</strong> – Recruitment / Data Analysis contributor within the Dutch men’s professional system (previous role referenced in the London City announcement). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Linköping FC</strong> – Opposition Scout / Analyst in the Swedish women’s top division. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>KNVB</strong> (Royal Netherlands Football Association) – Earlier work affiliation, as referenced in my profile. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Selected Projects & Analysis Work</h2>
    <p>
      Some independent or club-adjacent work I’ve completed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Set-Piece Value Model – Developed a metric to quantify the impact of corners and free-kicks in elite women’s football.  
      </li>
      <li>
        Emerging Talent Shortlist Pipeline – Designed and executed a workflow combining Wyscout/FBref data and video scouting for U23 attackers in the English Women’s Championship.  
      </li>
      <li>
        Opposition Snapshot Series – Created tactical and data reports for upcoming opponents in the Swedish Damallsvenskan, combining pressing profiles, transition threat and expected goals data in both video and slide format.  
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Bring to the Table</h2>
    <p>
      • A hybrid skill-set: video scouting, data modelling, tactical understanding.  
      <br>
      • Experience across different markets and contexts (NL, SE, UK; men’s & women’s).  
      <br>
      • A focus on actionable insight: not just numbers, but what they mean for recruitment, squad building, and match preparation.
